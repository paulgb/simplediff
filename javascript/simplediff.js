/* 
Simple Diff for Python version 1.0 (ported to javascript)

Annotate two versions of a list with the values that have been
changed between the versions, similar to unix's `diff` but with
a dead-simple Python interface.

var diff = function(before, after) {
    /*
        Find the differences between two lists. Returns a list of pairs, where the
        first value is in ['+','-','='] and represents an insertion, deletion, or
        no change for that list. The second value of the pair is the list
        of elements.

        Params:
            before  the old list of immutable, comparable values (ie. a list
                    of strings)
            after   the new list of immutable, comparable values

        Returns:
            A list of pairs, with the first part of the pair being one of three
            strings ('-', '+', '=') and the second part being a list of values from
            the original before and/or after lists. The first part of the pair
            corresponds to whether the list of values is a deletion, insertion, or
            unchanged, respectively.

        Examples:
            diff([1,2,3,4],[1,3,4])
            [["=",[1]],["-",[2]],["=",[4]]]

            diff([1,2,3,4],[2,3,4,1])

        A diff should satisfy the property that the before input is equal to the
        elements of the result annotated with '-' or '=' concatenated together.
        Likewise, the after input is equal to the elements of the result annotated
        with '+' or '=' concatenated together. This function compares `before`,
        `after`, and the results of `diff(before, after)` to ensure this is true.

            checkDiff('Foobarbaz', 'Foobarbaz')
            checkDiff('Foobarbaz', 'Boobazbam')
